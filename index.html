        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>Guess a letter:
            <li>Start by guessing any letter you think might be in the hidden word. You may only guess one letter at at time</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>Check the word:
            <li>If the letter you guessed is in the word, it will be added to the correct place in the word</li>
            <li>If the letter you guessed isn't in the the word, part of the hangman's body will appear </li>
        </ol>
        Win or Lose:
        <ul>
            <li>Win: You win if you can guess the entire word before the hangman's body is completely drawn</li>
            <li>Lose: You lose the game if the hangman's body is completely drawn before you can fully guess the word or you guess wrong four times</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>Keep Guessing:
           <ul>Continue guessing letters one at a time. Each time you guess wrong, more of the hangman figure will appear</ul>
