### Background Information:

- I choose this project because this is a game I used to play with my cousins when I was a kid living in Michigan. I thought creating a hangman game would be a challenging but fun experience as well as something that could keep me connected with my cosuins back home, as I now live in California. I recently drove back to Michigan to spend time with my cousins and this game was something that reminded me of them (home away from home). 

### Description: 

- This game is a hangman game aka, a word-guessing game where the computer selects a hidden word and the players goal is to guess the entire word one letter at a time with a max of four incorrect guesses before loss. The word first appears as a set of underscores that each respresent a letter for the player to guess. If the players guessed letter is apart of the hidden word, it will appear ontop of the underscore mark in the correct position. If the letter guessed by the player isn't part of the word, the with the mistake tracker will decrease from 4 down. The player wins by guessing all the letters within the words before they reach the max amount of incorrect guesses. The game then renders a win/lose message.
